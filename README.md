The machine should satisfy the following requirements:
- Machine should have python3 installed.
- Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download all the required libraries. The external libraries required are as follows:
  - numpy
  - cv2
  - matplotlib
  - mtcnn (optional, required for face extraction) 

- For running the code, follow the command format as: `python3 Methods/method1.py <relative_path_to_image1> <relative_path_to_image2>`. 
- For example, if we want to compare images/musk0.jpg and images/musk1.jpg, we will give the command as `python3 Methods/method1.py images/musk0.jpg images/musk1.jpg`. 
- Similar commands is used for method2 and method3 as well.
